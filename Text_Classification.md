Most text classification and document categorization systems can be deconstructed into the following four phases:
* [Feature extraction](#fe)
* [Dimensionality Reduction](#dr)
* [Classifier selection](#cs)
* [Evaluations](#ev)

In general, the text classification system contains four different levels of scope that can be applied:
  1. Document level: In the document level, the algorithm obtains the relevant categories of a full document.
  2. Paragraph level: In the paragraph level, the algorithm obtains the relevant categories of a single paragraph (a portion of a document).
  3. Sentence level: In the sentence level, obtains the relevant categories of a single sentence (a portion of a paragraph).
  4. Sub-sentence level: In the sub-sentence level, the algorithm obtains the relevant categories of sub-expressions within a sentence (a portion of a sentence )).
  
# 2- Feature Extraction<a name="fe"></a>
In this secion, we introduce methods for cleaning text data sets, thus removing implicit noise and allowing for informative featurization. 

## 2.1. Text Cleaning and Pre-processing
In many algorithms, especially statistical and probabilistic learning algorithms, Unnecessary words such as stopwords, misspelling, slang, etc. and unnecessary features can have adverse effects on system performance:

### 2.1.1. Tokenization
Tokenization is a pre-processing method which breaks a stream of text into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens. The main goal of this step is the investigation of the words in a sentence.

  >_After sleeping for four hours, he decided to sleep for another four._
  >_{ “After” “sleeping” “for” “four” “hours” “he” “decided” “to” “sleep” “for” “another” “four” }_
  


Two common methods of text feature extraction: Weighted word and word embedding techniques:
