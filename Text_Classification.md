Most text classification and document categorization systems can be deconstructed into the following four phases:
* [Feature extraction](#fe)
* Dimension reductions
* Classifier selection
* Evaluations

In general, the text classification system contains four different levels of scope that can be applied:
  1. Document level: In the document level, the algorithm obtains the relevant categories of a full document.
  2. Paragraph level: In the paragraph level, the algorithm obtains the relevant categories of a single paragraph (a portion of a document).
  3. Sentence level: In the sentence level, obtains the relevant categories of a single sentence (a portion of a paragraph).
  4. Sub-sentence level: In the sub-sentence level, the algorithm obtains the relevant categories of sub-expressions within a sentence (a portion of a sentence )).
